<b><font color="#ddddff">ABC 80 ('85)</font></b>
</td></tr></table>
I went to this basic-course at Medborgarskolan in '85 and that was my first real experience
with computers and I got hooked instantly. The ABC-80 was a swedish computer created
by Luxor - if you're interested there's an emulator
<a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~exon/archive.html">here</a>.
<ul>
<li><b>Masken-slalom</b><br>A simple game where you have to steer a worm down a course. I don't
remember exactly how much of this game I wrote since there where other people invovled,
but I know I did a (remake :) of it on the C64 later on.
</ul>
<table width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#4466ee">
<b><font color="#ddddff">C64 Basic ('86-'89)</font></b>
</td></tr></table>
In '86 me and my brother got a C64 to share. I continued my BASIC-programming and did
many small programs. None of them are still with us (*sob*) and I don't even remember
most of them, but these are some:
<ul>
<li><b>Wilhelm Tell</b><br>You controlled a crossbow (sprite) on the left hand of the screen and
 had to shoot an apple (also a sprite) from the head of a man (character-graphics) on the right
 side of the screen. Made together with some modestly computer-interested friends in my neighborhood.<p>
<li><b>Mister Register</b><br>A small register program where you could register persons with adresses
and phonenumbers - and even load & save the data to tape.<p>
<li><b>Dragon Warriors</b><br>This I did a bit later, when I actually had a diskdrive. It was based
on the RPG <i>Dragon Warriors</i> and it let you roll your own characters and I think I had some
type of combat in there too... and the beginning of some actual gameplay, but I dont think I got
that far.
</ul>
<table width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#4466ee">
<b><font color="#ddddff">C64 Assembler</font></b>
</td></tr></table>
Actually, I never really got around to program assembler on the 64 until just before I bought
my Amiga. All I did then was a character-clear routine for Dragon Warriors mentioned above,
and some other tests. I got back to it later though and made one actual program.
<ul>
<li><b>Playsid64</b><br>A program for playing c64-music on the c64! Eh, ok I know it doesn't
sound that special but it was my first and only project. It loaded the file of your choise,
parsing and printing the song-data on the screen (where the loader and player also relocated
itself to so it handled music from before the basic-start (<tt>$801</tt> or <tt>$810</tt> ?)
and up to <tt>$ffff</tt> which I was pretty pleased with :)
</ul>
<table width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#4466ee">
<b><font color="#ddddff">Amiga Demos ('90-'93)</font></b>
</td></tr></table>
Summer of '90 was when I first started programming for real on the Amiga; In Assembler
of course. At the time I had mostly been mail-swapping games (ah-hem) with people, but
soon dropped that in favour of the wonderful world of copperlists & vectorbobs, first
reading the assembler-articles in Datormagazin, then diving into more
<a href="books.html">serious litterature</a>.
<ul>
<li><b>Cyberpunks-demo</b><br>
A week before the Swedish demo-event of the year, The Horizon party, I started coding on
a demo and almost in time I had the buggy, evil, ugly piece of assembler that was the
first and only demo from Cyber Punks as me and two other guys called us then (allthough
they had nothing to do with the demo and wasn't really into computers). Lucky for
us, it didnt work well enough to be releasable at the party.<br>
<a href="1stdemo.html"><font color="white">Details</font></a>
</ul>
Here me and a few people from the group <i>Cizeron</i> got together to form the group
<i>Azure</i>.
<ul>
<li><b>Azure-demo</b><br>This I'm a bit more pleased with. It was really called <i>Skull-demo</i>
since it started with a laughing skeleton (shamelessly ripped from Barbarian II) and featured
a bouncing logo, a sine-scroll and some nice rasters, and also with some descent graphcis from
<i>Skutt</i> and music by <i>Radioactivator</i> (I think we asked him if we could use the tune
but I'm not sure :)<br>
<a href="skulldemo.html"><font color="white">Details</font></a>
<p>
<li><b>Inzine!</b><br>New group-name, <i>Puddle</i> with a very modest attitude (as you may gather
from the name :) Inzine! was released at a small Atari party in Uppsala and featured a really
big sine-scroll and some other stuff<br>
<a href="inzine.html"><font color="white">Details</font></a>
<p>
</ul>
At this point most of the people dropped out (Skutt went back to Cizeron who renamed themselves to
<i>Hardcore Design</i>) or lost interest so I joined the newly formed group <i>Oxygen</i>.
Much more detail on the upcoming <a href="oxygen_demos.html">oxygen page</a>.
<ul>
<li><b>O2Intro</b><br>My first production for Oxygen was a cute little intro which we made as
a reply to an ugly fake-demo that a group called <i>Them</i> (Later <i>Virutal</i>) had
released in our name<br>
<a href="o2intro.html"><font color="white">Details</font></a>
<p>
<li><b>Justice</b><br>The biggest demo I've made. Contains many effects but very little
design so it's pretty boring (allthough not really ugly). Released at the Party 1 in Denmark.<br>
<a href="justice.html"><font color="white">Details</font></a>
<p>
<li><b>Celeste BBS-Intro</b><br>I wrote this while I was doing my service in the army.
Small intro for a BBS I ran at the time.<br>
<a href="celeste.html"><font color="white">Details</font></a>
<p>
<li><b>Boot intro</b><br>Ah, one of my coolest releases :) An oxygen logo, transforming vectors,
a starscroll, some text and a piece of music - all in less than 1024 bytes.<br>
<a href="bootintro.html"><font color="white">Details</font></a>
<p>
<li><b>Various intros</b><br>
I also wrote a bunch of other small intros. Here are some screenshots<br>
<a href="intros.html"><font color="white">Details</font></a>
<p>
<li><b>Quick Musique</b><br>A musicdisk that I had really worked
on... with trackloading, a very nice menu, fullscreen oscilloscope and equalizers. Unfortunatly,
it was on a HD that was stolen on the party we arranged with Abstract. The only thing I have
of it now is a semi-complete version on an amiga-disk<br>
<a href="quickmusique.html"><font color="white">Details</font></a>
<p>
</ul>
Those where the only real releases during this period... if you don't count stuff like:
<ul>
<li><b>Pixtro</b><br>Released for an <i>on-the-side</i> group called <i>Avocado Design</i>. Featured
a single pixel bouncing around :)<p>
<li><b>Anal-intro</b><br>A one-day-hack hate-demo directed at a group called Anal Intruders
(yes, they deserved it, they where a bunch of assholes). Pretty funny, but this one is also
gone (if anyone still has it please <a href="mailto:jonas@upright.se">mail</a> it!)<p>
</ul>
<table width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#4466ee">
<b><font color="#ddddff">Amiga Cracks</font></b>
</td></tr></table>
Yes, I occationally found it interesting to dig around in other peoples code... then
these things can easily happen :)
<ul>
<li><b>Falcon</b><br>Simple removal of the password check in the executable.<p>
<li><b>Supremacy</b><br>Also password check, but this game was trackloaded. I had to
put code in the bootblock that inserted jumps to itself at several stages during
the loading to finally be able to remove the password-check when it was in memory.<p>
<li><b>PolyEd</b><br>Patched so it always thought it was registered.<p>
<li><b>Spot</b><br>Same, but made it crash in certain situations. There was a more widespread
crack of this program that had the exact same problem.<p>
</ul>
<table width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#4466ee">
<b><font color="#ddddff">Amiga C & Other ('93-'97)</font></b>
</td></tr></table>
<ul>
<li><b>Wolfdemo</b><br>One of the last things I made in Assembler for the Amiga was
a Wolfenstein-like demo (or doom-like as most people referred to them). I actually
had a pretty fast routine but the code got to messy and I found it very tricky to
put objects into the engine...<br>
<a href="wolfdemo.html"><font color="white">Details</font></a>
<p>
<li><b>odsys</b><br>A graphic-system for 2D-games. Featured run-length encoded sprites,
resource-file handling and floyd-steinberg dithering of graphics which made it possible
to run the same binary in a window or fullscreen and on plain OCS Amigas, AGA or Graphic-
card equipped ones. This was actually pretty serious stuff when I think of it...<br>

<table width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#4466ee">
<b><font color="#ddddff">TI92</font></b>
</td></tr></table>
When I heard of this monster calculator in the summer of '96
I went out and bought it instantly. It contains a 10MHz 68000 processor (just
like the old Amiga!), a QWERTY-keyboard and a 240x128 pixel display. It wasn't
possible to program it in Assembler at the time I bought it, but it was only
a matter of time since all earlier Texas Instruments calculators had been
hacked to allow it. When it happened I wrote (among others) these:
<ul>
<li><b>Vectordemo</b><br>
Bouncing vector sporting a pretty optimized bresenham-routine.<p>
<li><b>Scrolling Bullock</b><br>Big picture of Sandra Bullock showing
off grayscale graphics :)<p>
<li><b>Asm92</b><br>An actual 68000-assembler. Never released
since it wasn't complete (some supervisor opcodes wasn't implemented).
Made to look like Asmone; prompt based (except it had no editor).<p>
</ul>
<table width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#4466ee">
<b><font color="#ddddff">Linux ('97-)</font></b>
</td></tr></table>
I bought my first PC (a notebook) as late as Fall '97, and I didn't install Linux
right away - but after experimenting a bit with x86-assembler under DOS I downloaded
and installed Slackware Linux and that has been my main operating system since.
<ul>
<li><b>Tiger</b><br>An emulator for the TI92-calculator mentioned above. As it was
the first released it grew pretty popular among the <a href="http://www.ticalc.org">
TI-community</a>. You can get more
information on the <a href="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~md94-jmi/tiger/">
Official Tiger Page</a>, allthough I haven't updated it for ages. Here is
a <a href="tiger075.gif">screenshot</a><p>
<li><b>Duke</b><br>Quick hack to make a curses (text) based mp3-player to use on a
VT100-terminal I thougth I was going to get. Never got the Terminal, never really
finished the program. More info
<a href="http://www.student.nada.kth.se/~md94-jmi/duke.html">here</a><p>
<li><b>O3dLib</b><br>Current project to make a 3D-engine, go <a href="o3d/index.html">here</a>
